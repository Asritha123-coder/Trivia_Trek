🔥 Important Logic Used
1️⃣ State Management (useState + useRef)

Used to store quiz state, avoid unnecessary re-renders, and prevent duplicate API calls.

2️⃣ useEffect for Debouncing & Error Handling

Prevents multiple API calls when switching categories quickly.

3️⃣ useMemo for Performance Boost

Used for:

Leaderboard calculations

Counting answered questions

4️⃣ Data Normalization

Custom questions + API questions → converted into:

correct_answer
incorrect_answers
merged


So quiz logic stays consistent.
